Mac OS Installation
===================

Some additional steps beyond the standard installation instructions may be
required for certain macOS systems.

The steps detailed in this document were last tested for **macOS 10.14.1**.

   1. `Xcode Command Line Tools`_
   2. `Homebrew`_

2. `Troubleshooting`_

   1. `Python 3`_
   2. `PyQtGraph`_
   3. `Matplotlib`_
   4. `CFITSIO`_

Requirements
============

The following packages are required in order to build PySAP:

1. ``gcc``

  Or any c/c++ compiler that supports OpenMP. (Note that the native Mac
  OS ``clang`` does not)

2. ``cmake``

Xcode Command Line Tools
------------------------

An essential first step for any developer working on macOS is to install the command line tools. This can be done as follows

.. code-block:: bash

  xcode-select --install

Homebrew
--------

The above listed requirements can be readily installed on Mac OS using |link-to-brew|.

.. |link-to-brew| raw:: html

  <a href="https://brew.sh/"
  target="_blank">Homebrew</a>

.. code-block:: bash

  brew install gcc cmake

Note that the commands ``gcc`` and ``g++`` default to ``clang``. Before
installing PySAP you should export the environment variables ``CC`` and ``CXX``.

*e.g.*

.. code-block:: bash

  export CC="/usr/local/bin/gcc-8"
  export CXX="/usr/local/bin/g++-8"

If you encounter problems re-compiling PySAP following an OS update it may be necessary to uninstall Homebrew and repeat these steps.

In some cases Boost will have trouble finding the correct version of gcc, if so the following hack can be implemented (even just temporarily).

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /usr/local/bin
   ln -s gcc-8 gcc
   ln -s g++-8 g++
   ln -s gcc cc
   ln -s g++ c++

Troubleshooting
===============

The following subsections propose solutions to some known issues.

Python 3
--------

For some Python 3 installations (such as Anaconda) the ``Python.h`` header file is
located in a directory called ``python3.Xm`` (where X is the minor version number).
This causes issues with Boost, which looks for this header file in ``python3.X``.

*e.g.*

.. code-block:: bash

  In file included from ./boost/python/detail/prefix.hpp:13:0,
                 from ./boost/python/list.hpp:8,
                 from libs/python/src/list.cpp:5:
  ./boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:11: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory
  # include <pyconfig.h>
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~
  compilation terminated.

This can be easily solved by exporting the following

.. code-block:: bash

  export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/PATH-TO-PYTHON/include/python3.Xm


PyQtGraph
---------

Some issues may arise with regards to the installation of ``pyqtgraph``. The
easiest solution to this problem is to install the package using |link-to-conda|.

.. |link-to-conda| raw:: html

  <a href="https://conda.io/docs/"
  target="_blank">Anaconda</a>

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install pyqtgraph

Alternatively see the |link-to-pyqt| for help.

.. |link-to-pyqt| raw:: html

  <a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org/"
  target="_blank">PyQtGraph homepage</a>

Matplotlib
----------

If you see the following error or something similar

.. code-block:: bash

  **RuntimeError**: Python is not installed as a framework...

simply create a ``matplotlibrc`` file and specify a backend.

*e.g.*

.. code-block:: bash

  echo "backend: Agg" >> ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc

CFITSIO
-------

If you encounter this error

.. code-block:: bash

  configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
  If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
  See `config.log' for more details
  make[2]: *** [cfitsio/src/cfitsio-stamp/cfitsio-configure] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/cfitsio.dir/all] Error 2
  make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

It may be necessary to install the macOS SDK headers. This can be done as follows

.. code-block:: bash

  cd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/
  open macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
