Galaxy Image Deconvolution
==========================

.. codeauthor:: Samuel Farrens <samuel.farrens@cea.fr>

In this tutorial we will deconvolve the PSF effects from an example galaxy
image using the PySAP-Astro plug-in.

Import dependencies
-------------------

Import functions from PySAP and
`ModOpt <https://cea-cosmic.github.io/ModOpt/>`_.

Load astro data
---------------

First, we load some example images from the PySAP sample data sets.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-34

.. code-block:: default


    galaxy = get_sample_data('astro-galaxy')
    psf = get_sample_data('astro-psf')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-36

Then we can show the clean galaxy image that we will attempt to recover.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-40

.. code-block:: default


    plt.imshow(galaxy)
    plt.show()

Generate a noisy observation
----------------------------

To simulate an observation we convolve the image with a point spread function
(PSF) using the ModOpt :py:func:`convolve <modopt.math.convolve.convolve>`
function. Then we add random Gaussian noise with standard deviation
``0.0005`` using the ModOpt
:py:func:`add_noise <modopt.signal.noise.add_noise>` function.

.. code-block:: default


    obs_data = add_noise(convolve(galaxy.data, psf.data), sigma=0.0005)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-54

Now we can show the noisy and blurred galaxy image.

Deconvolve
----------

We will use the :py:func:`sparse_deconv_condatvu
<astro.deconvolution.deconvolve.sparse_deconv_condatvu>` function from
PySAP-Astro to deconvolve the noisy image. We set the maximum number of
iterations for this function to ``3000``.

Residual
--------

Next, we calculate the residual of our deconvolved image to get a measure of
how well the deconvolution process performed.

 Typically for a denoising problem we are aiming for a residual without any
 structure, i.e. just noise.
